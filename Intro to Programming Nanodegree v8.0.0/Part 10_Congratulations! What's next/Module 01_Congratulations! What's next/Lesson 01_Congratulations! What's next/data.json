Perhaps you'll be a Data Analyst for 3 years. Then you'll jump into the world of Front-End Web Development for 5 years. And then end up creating Machine Learning algorithms for a gaming company the next 10 years. \n\nWhatever it is you choose to pursue, keep these three things in mind:\n\n1. Learning takes time and consistency — make a learning schedule!\n2. Someone has done it before — ask the internet!\n3. Be curious and continue to learn new things each and every day.",
