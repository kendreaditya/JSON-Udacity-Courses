I want you to use what you've learned up to this point to complete the following project. Simply titled, \"Animal Trading Cards\", this project combines the skills you mastered in the problem set and asks you to re-create a webpage from a design prototype.\n\nThis is a common workflow for front-end web developers. Typically, you'll be provided with a design prototype that needs to be translated to an actual, functional website. In most cases, designers only provide you with the design prototype. However, for this project, I've provided you with the design prototype and the HTML. The design prototype used in this project is inspired by trading cards and features a fish you might recognize from a popular animated film. You‚Äôll be creating the card and swapping out the fish with an animal of your choice.",

View the Project Rubric     \nWhen doing a Udacity Project, it's an excellent habit to view the rubric once before doing the project *(to understand the requirements)* and once after doing the project *(to check your work)*. You can go to the [Project Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/151/view) page to read the details.  For your convenience, the next page also describes the rubric. \n\n#### 2. Download Project Template   \nDownload and unzip [animal-trading-cards-master.zip](https://github.com/udacity/animal-trading-cards/archive/master.zip). Inside, you'll find `card.html`, `styles.css`, `placeholder.png`, and the `design-prototype.png`.    \n\n\n#### 3. Have a look at each of the files. \n- Open `card.html` and view its code. See how it renders in the browser. \n- Have a look at the `design-prototype.png`. Note down what you notice about the styling or structure of the prototype.    \n- The `styles.css` will be blank. You will be adding the `CSS` here. \n- The `placeholder.png` is a blank image that is used as a placeholder instead of an animal's picture.      \n\n\nYour job is to try and make your card resemble what you see in the `design-prototype.jpg`. You‚Äôll need to modify `card.html` to include `attributes` and use CSS `selectors` to style specific elements.     \n\n\n#### 4.  Customize `card.html`  \n\n\n- Open `card.html`.      \n\n\n- Download your favorite animal's image. I personally love pandas so I have downloaded a pandas' image.     ",

Make sure you use meaningful names for CSS classes. \n\n\n- Link your stylesheet in `card.html` or else your CSS, `styles.css` will not be applied to your webpage.  You will not be including any `<style>` elements or `style` attributes in the body of `card.html`.    \n\n\n- Replace the current information with your animal's information. Information will refer to:  \n    - The Animal's Name\n    - The Interesting Fact about the Animal\n    - The List of Items for your Animal's Characteristics. \n    - Your Animal's Brief Description.

Customize `styles.css`      \n\nOpen `styles.css` and apply the following style to match the design prototype:     \n- For the image, you will want to use an image with a `width` of 300 pixels. If your image is larger, you can set the image's width to 300 pixels in your `CSS`, but be aware that your image might end up squished or distorted. Later, we'll talk about how you can fix this problem using [responsive images](https://www.udacity.com/course/responsive-images--ud882).        \n\n\n- The entire card's width should be fixed and include the spacing around the image (Since image is 300px wide, card should be 300px + spacing on either side.) The card should not expand with the browser window.         \n\n\n- Italicized text for the animal's interesting fact.      \n\n\n- Bold the Labels for the animals' list items (e.g. 'Habitat'). Note that you have to only bold the labels, not the entire list items.      \n\n\n- No dots for the animal's list items.        \n\n\n- Border around the animal name, image and it's information (interesting fact, list items, and description). Make sure you set the `border-style`, `border-width` and `border-color`. You can even do it in one line.      \n\n\n\n- Spacing / [Padding](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/padding) around the animal's name, image, the list of items and the information.      \n\n \nFeel free to customize your information and styles so long as you follow the above rules. For inspiration, you can try playing around with background colors or border-radius.  You can even add a box shadow on the entire card.      ",
