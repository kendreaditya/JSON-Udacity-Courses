Labs are similar to projects, but instead of being evaluated by a reviewer, they are automatically graded. \n\nThis lab is an opportunity for you to submit what you've written in your `notes.html` file, or write some new HTML to further practice the skills you've learned! \n\nYou will submit a basic HTML page with at least one **hyperlink** and one **image**, but you are welcome to include anything else you'd like! As long as you fulfill the requirements, there will be no penalty for additional features on the page. \n\nThe lab will look very similar to the workspaces you've seen so far, but when you run your code you'll receive a response: either that your HTML passed the specifications, or it didn't.\n\nIf your HTML *doesn't* pass, pay attention to the feedback written in **<span style=\"color: green; \"> <b> green </b>**, which are the parts of the lab that you've passed, and the feedback written in  **<span style=\"color: red; \"> <b> red </b>**, which are the parts of the lab that you didn't pass. When you've fixed all of issues described by the **<span style=\"color: red; \"> <b> red </b>** feedback, you'll be able to move on!\n\nIf you get stuck along the way, make sure to refer back to past videos and exercises, and ask questions in [Knowledge](https://knowledge.udacity.com) and your Study Group.
