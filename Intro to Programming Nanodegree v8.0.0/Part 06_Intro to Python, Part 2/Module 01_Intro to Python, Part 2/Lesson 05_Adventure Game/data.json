That's no good.\n\nIf you look at the example game, there's a short delay after each line is printed.\n\nYou may remember that earlier in the course, we briefly introduced the `time` module and the `time.sleep()` function:\n\n```python\nimport time\nprint(\"Hello\")\ntime.sleep(2)\nprint(\"world!\")\n```\n\nThis will cause a 2-second delay after the first `print()` statement.

If you haven't already, this would be a good time to consider defining some functions, and moving some of your code into those functions.\n\nFor example, you probably have a lot of code that looks like this:\n\n```python\nprint(\"You find yourself standing in an open field, filled with grass and\",\n      \"yellow wildflowers.\")\ntime.sleep(2)\nprint(\"Rumor has it that a wicked fairie is somewhere around here, and has\",\n      \"been terrifying the nearby village.\")\ntime.sleep(2)\nprint(\"In front of you is a house.\")\ntime.sleep(2)\nprint(\"To your right is a dark cave.\")\ntime.sleep(2)\nprint(\"In your hand you hold your trusty (but not very effective) dagger.\")\ntime.sleep(2)\n....\n```\n\nThis is quite repetitive—we are using `print`, `sleep`, `print`, `sleep`, `print`, `sleep`,  over and over ...\n\nOne improvement that you can make is to define your own function so that it will both print and sleep—you might call it the `print_pause` function.\n\nWith such a function, you could simply pass it a message to print, and it would take care of the pausing:\n\n```python\nprint_pause(\"You find yourself standing in an open field, filled with grass\",\n            \"and yellow wildflowers.\")\nprint_pause(\"Rumor has it that a wicked fairie is somewhere around here,\",\n            \"and has been terrifying the nearby village.\")\nprint_pause(\"In front of you is a house.\")\nprint_pause(\"To your right is a dark cave.\")\nprint_pause(\"In your hand you hold your trusty (but not very effective)\",\n            \"dagger.\")\n....\n\n``` ",

              "text": "\nHere's another way you can use functions in a game like this—you can define a function for each place the player can go. In the example game, the code looks something like this:\n\n```python\ndef fight():\n    # Things that happen when the player fights  \n    \ndef cave():\n    # Things that happen to the player goes in the cave  \n    \ndef field():\n    # Things that happen when the player runs back to the field\n    \ndef house():\n    # Things that happen to the player in the house\n```   \n\nThat way, when the player chooses to go to one of these places, you can simply call the function that displays the description and choices for that place. This is especially good if you want the player to be able to go back to the same place repeatedly, from different locations in the code. In the example game, the player can get back to the field from both the house and the cave, and having the `field` function makes this much easier.\n\nUsually, each function will print what happens after the player takes a certain choice, then offer another choice, and call the specific function depending on the choice the player makes.  In the end, you would want to have a `play_game()` or `main()` function, which starts the game. \n\nThese are just a few examples of how you can use functions in your project. You'll probably find other ways you can clean up the code and reduce repetitiveness by defining (and calling) functions. (In fact, it's possible to do this project with almost every line of code being placed inside a function definition!)",

If everything always happens exactly the same way, it can become boring and predictable.\n\nThere are all sorts of ways you could use randomness in your game. Here are just a few possibilities:\n* In the example game, the enemy creature is selected randomly each time they play. Sometimes it's a pirate, sometimes it's a troll, and so on.\n* You could do something similar to randomize which weapons or magical items the player encounters.\n* You could include a combat simulation in which the player and enemy deal random amounts of damage to one another (you may remember that we did something like this earlier in the course).\n\nAll of these can be done using Python's [`random`](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd000/parts/eedbe18d-9f9a-4512-8efa-e122f54c3e02/modules/4b7c78c4-9f10-4169-a34b-2bfa966d87be/lessons/ce44e4e0-c3f1-4657-a4bc-2b71fd2cda91/concepts/87d3129d-c6eb-4d9d-ac41-c301673a59e5) module and the [`random.choice`](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd000/parts/eedbe18d-9f9a-4512-8efa-e122f54c3e02/modules/4b7c78c4-9f10-4169-a34b-2bfa966d87be/lessons/ce44e4e0-c3f1-4657-a4bc-2b71fd2cda91/concepts/87d3129d-c6eb-4d9d-ac41-c301673a59e5) and [`random.randint`](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd000/parts/eedbe18d-9f9a-4512-8efa-e122f54c3e02/modules/4b7c78c4-9f10-4169-a34b-2bfa966d87be/lessons/ce44e4e0-c3f1-4657-a4bc-2b71fd2cda91/concepts/87d3129d-c6eb-4d9d-ac41-c301673a59e5) functions that we learned about earlier. For example: At the start of each game, you can set the random enemy creature. \n\nThere are countless other possible ways to use randomness in your game—feel free to be creative here.  ",

Create *win* and *lose* conditions\n\nEventually, the game should come to an end—and tell the player that they won or lost.\n\nThe end result of the game should be influenced by the player's choices (and possibly some degree of randomness as well). Generally, it's a good idea to use randomness to only *partially* influence the outcome.

[Here](https://pep8.org/) is a nice website you can go through to understand the PEP8 style guide. \n\nIn any of the errors, it'll tell you the row, and column number of where the error occurs. you can just google on how to fix each, but here are some examples.\n\n- `adventure_game.py:6:1: W191 indentation contains tabs`: It's saying that on line 6, column 1, the indentation contains tabs. To fix this, just replace all tabs with 4 spaces using the find and replace option in your code editor.        \n\n\n\n\n- `adventure_game.py:7:38: E225 missing whitespace around operator`: This error occurs when we don't leave a space between an operator and the numbers/strings on both sides. For example, instead of writing `print(2 + 2)`, we wrote `print(2+ 2)`. This can be fixed by having space on both sides of the operator.           \n\n\n\n\n- `adventure_game.py:12:47: W291 trailing whitespace`: This error occurs when we have some trailing whitespace at the end of the line of code. Just clear that extra whitespace at the end of each line of code.       \n\n\n\n\n- `adventure_game.py:21:80: E501 line too long (92 > 79 characters)`: Make sure each line of code is less than 79 characters. If you are printing a sentence longer than that, split the line into two using a comma, like this:   \n```python\nprint_pause(\"You find yourself standing in an open field, filled with grass\",\n            \"and yellow wildflowers.\")\n```   \nAlso, note how the lines separated by a comma are indented equally inside the `print_pause` function.     \n\n- `adventure_game.py:23:9: E101 indentation contains mixed spaces and tabs`: This means that on line 23, column 9, you are using a mix of spaces and tabs for indentation. Again, just replace all tabs with 4 spaces using the Find and Replace option in your code editor.      \n\n- `adventure_game.py:100:1: E305 expected 2 blank lines after class or function definition, found 1`: This is quite descriptive. Just leave 2 lines between function definitions.       \n\nAs you can see, the errors are very descriptive so you won't need google all the time to figure out how to fix such errors.   ",

If the player enters a choice that is not valid, the game gives them the chance to retry until they enter a valid option. The game does not crash and does not treat invalid input as a valid choice.      \n\n\n- The program's code is refactored by defining and calling functions. The code includes at least four-function definitions that are used to improve the code in some way, such as by:\n    - Reducing repetition\n    - Reducing complexity\n    - Improving the readability or organization of the code    \n\n- Each function should have a single purpose and a name that describes that purpose.     \n\n\n- The code written follows the standard Python Style Guide, such that  `pycodestyle` tool reports zero errors and zero warnings.     \n\n\n- The program is a playable game, and runs from start to finish without crashing or displaying errors.     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
