In this project you will construct a recurrent neural network for the purpose of determining the sentiment of a movie review using the IMDB data set. You will create this model using Amazon's SageMaker service. In addition, you will deploy your model and construct a simple web app which will interact with the deployed model.\n\n## Project Instructions\n\nThe deployment project which you will be working on is intended to be done using Amazon's SageMaker platform. In particular, it is assumed that you have a working notebook instance in which you can clone the deployment repository.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nYour project will be reviewed by a Udacity reviewer against the deployment project [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/2262/view).  Review this rubric thoroughly, and self-evaluate your project before submission.  All criteria found in the rubric must meet specifications for you to pass.\n\n## Project Submission\n\nWhen you are ready to submit your project, collect all of the files in the project directory and compress them into a single archive for upload. In particular, make sure that the following files are included:\n- The `SageMaker Project.ipynb` file with fully functional code, **all code cells executed and displaying output**, and **all questions answered**.\n- An HTML or PDF export of the project notebook with the name `report.html` or `report.pdf`.\n- The completed `train/train.py` and `serve/predict.py` python files.\n- The edited `website/index.html` file.\n\nAlternatively, your submission could consist of the GitHub link to your repository.\n\n## Project Submission Checklist\n\n**Before submitting your project, please review and confirm the following items.** \n<input type=\"checkbox\"> I am confident all rubric items have been met and my project will pass as submitted. \n<input type=\"checkbox\"> Project builds correctly without errors and runs.\n<input type=\"checkbox\"> All required functionality exists and my project behaves as expected per the project's specifications.\n\n**Once you have checked all these items, you are ready to submit!**\n\n### Ready to submit your project?\n\nClick on the \"Submit Project\" button and follow the instructions to submit!",

In particular, it is assumed that you have a working notebook instance in which you can clone the deployment repository.\n\nIf you have not yet done this, please see the beginning of Lesson 2 in which we walk through creating a notebook instance and cloning the deployment repository. Alternatively, you can follow the instructions below.\n\nFirst, start by logging in to the [AWS console](http://console.aws.amazon.com), opening the SageMaker dashboard and clicking on **Create notebook instance**.\n\nYou may choose any name you would like for your notebook. A **ml.t2.medium** is used to launch the notebook and is available by default. Inside the notebook **ml.p2.xlarge** is used for __training__ a model and **ml.m4.xlarge** is used for __deployment__. These instance may not be available to all users by default.  If you haven't requested **ml.p2.xlarge** so far please follow the instructions on the next page to request it now.\n\nNext, under **IAM role** select **Create a new role**. You should get a pop-up window that looks like the one below. The only change that needs to be made is to select **None** under **S3 buckets you specify**, as is shown in the image below.",
