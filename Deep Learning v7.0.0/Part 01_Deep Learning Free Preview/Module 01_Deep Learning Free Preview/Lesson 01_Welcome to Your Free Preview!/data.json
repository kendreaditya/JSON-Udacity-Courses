You'll also get a chance to apply some deep learning models to do cool things like transferring the style of artwork to another image.\n\nWeâ€™ll start off with a simple introduction to linear regression and machine learning.

These projects are designed to be challenging and interesting, as such, you may not always pass on the first attempt, but, if you are enrolled in our complete program, you will get feedback from a real person; a Udacity reviewer. This reviewer will help you figure out what could be improved in your code and you can submit your code again until you pass the project.\n\nHere are the five projects, listed for convenience:\n\n>1. Predicting Bike-Sharing Data\n2. Dog Breed Classifier\n3. Generate TV Scripts\n4. Generate Faces\n3. Deploy a Sentiment Analysis Model\n\nYou are also encouraged to keep a public portfolio of completed project code on a personal Github or write a blog posts about your problem-solving approach.",
