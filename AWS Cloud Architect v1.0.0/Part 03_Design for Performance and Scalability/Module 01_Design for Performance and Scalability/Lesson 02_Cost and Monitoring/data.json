N California is more expensive than Northern Virginia and Mumbai.\n\nThere are many reasons for the price difference. Supply and demand, local government regulations and taxes, the cost of doing business such as land, construction and electricity.\n\n\n\nApplication performance and user satisfaction are the goals of a cloud architect. You will need to decide where to host your application, balancing costs with your performance goals. In some cases you will need to host your application in multiple regions in order to meet your obligations to your users. A strong understanding of how region affects cost will be useful as you advance in your careers.\n\n\n\n### Learn More About Cloud Costs and Pricing\n\nThe links below take you to cloud provider documentation on pricing and cost strategies.

It is best to use spot instances for batch processes that only need to run for a few hours and if AWS needs to stop your running instance and restart it later, there won’t be any lasting effects. If you are running a website that has longevity and you project that it will be running long into the future, it would be most cost effective to purchase reserved instances.",

The lifecycle policy is configured in the S3 management console.\n\n- Object lifecycle policies define both transitions and expirations\n\n- Object transitions define when an object is moved to another storage class; for example moving an object from S3 Standard to S3 Standard Infrequently Accessed after 60 days\n\n- Object expirations define when an object needs to expire out of the S3 bucket, and AWS deletes the file when the expiration conditions have been met\n\n- Once an object has transitioned out of S3 standard, it cannot go back. The object would have to be retrieved and re-uploaded to S3 Standard. \n\n- Lifecycle policies automate transitions and expirations to reduce storage costs by moving objects to less costly tiers, archiving them for long term storage, and deleting them to meet governance requirements\n",

While SQL databases can scale, they are mostly limited to vertical scaling. Costs begin to accelerate as the database scales out.\r<br>  \nNon-relational databases store data as key-value pairs. NoSQL databases are much more flexible and a good choice when your data structure is likely to change.  They are often used for mobile applications, gaming, and adtech.\r\n#### AWS DynamoDB  \n- Pricing is primarily based on Write Capacity Units (WCUs) and Read Capacity Units (RCUs).\n- As with RDS, you also pay for autoscaling, indexing, data transfer, and caching  \n- DynamoDB has some additional features and costs that are not associated with RDS databases\n - **DAX** - DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) that uses in-memory caching to reduce latency 10x\n - **Global Tables** - a multi-region, multi-master database providing fast local read/writes for large global applications by replicating DynamoDB tables across your selected regions\n - **DynamoDB Streams** - captures and writes streaming records in near real-time for consumption by applications that consume and process streams\n\n\n\n\n",

It makes sense to start with larger instances when you have already captured the metrics required to project your application’s future usage patterns and your application has consistent processing patterns. It also makes sense to start big when you are completely unsure of your applications usage patterns, but it is worth it to you to pay a little more to ensure you don’t experience an application outage due to exhausted resources. This is often the case when the cloud technology team doesn’t have an experienced cloud architect on the team. \n\nIt makes sense to employ elasticity when your application has bursts of activity at predictable intervals. For example, an application that is usually in use from 8-5 will scale up at 7 am and begin to scale down around 6 pm. It will run at reduced compute capacity until the next expected increase in activity and scale up.\n\nFor applications with completely unpredictable usage patterns, it makes sense to size according to the average usage and employ autoscaling so that AWS can respond to an increase/decrease in activity according to the criteria you specify.\n\n",

You need a response and support plan. You need appropriate alarms. You need to decide when you are done and when you are in an experimental phase. You need to decide how you are going to share results because monitoring metrics aren’t for everyone to view, particularly if they are tracking individual user activity.\n\n### AWS Cost Optimization Tools and Services\n\n- **AWS Cost Explorer** - Enables you to view and analyze your costs and usage in a graph or a report. Cost Explorer is very useful in forecasting costs and predicting where reserved instances may offer cost savings.\n<br><br>  \n- **AWS Cost Optimization Monitor** - Analyzes your billing reports and pulls out metrics to make them searchable and displays them in a customizable dashboard for analysis\n<br><br>   \n- **AWS Code Guru** -  Helps you proactively improve code quality and application performance with intelligent recommendations. It reviews your code and finds code issues during code reviews before they reach production, including needlessly costly lines of code, race conditions, memory leaks, and runaway logging.\n<br><br>   \n- **AWS Solution Architects** - Professional AWS certified engineers who are deployed by AWS to assist customers in solving the most challenging engineering problems. Costs for this assistance vary based on your support agreement and of course, the relative value of your account.\n<br><br>  \n- **AWS Account Credits** - Credits are available for startups, non-profits, and academic institutions. It never hurts to ask for AWS credits no matter who you are. \n\n### Baseline Monitoring\n\nMaintaining application availability and performance is dependent on a robust and well-defined monitoring policy. Establish your monitoring policy by:\n\n* Defining your goals\n* Document the resources that require monitoring\n* Selecting monitoring tools and tasks\n* Deciding who will respond to notifications, alerts, and alarms\n\nOnce you have created a monitoring policy, you must monitor your resources to establish your **monitoring baseline**. Your baseline is defined as normal resource or service performance in your environment. In order to determine your baseline metrics, you should measure how your environment performs under all anticipated conditions at all times of the day. This will give you an idea of what types of deviations to anticipate, and gives you an opportunity to address them in your monitoring plans. Some typical monitoring metrics for EC2 instances include:\n\n* CPU Utilization\n* Memory Utilization\n* Network Utilization\n* Disk Performance and Read/Writes\n* Disk Space",

After you are certain you have mitigated your error and no additional unwanted charges are accumulating, reach out to AWS and explain what happened. In many cases, especially during your yearlong free tier testing, they will be understanding and reverse the charges, but there are no guarantees. \n\nUnfortunately, they are not going to refund charges when you are surprised and disappointed by how much your crypto mining operations cost, versus how much currency you accumulated, so procure your AWS resources wisely.\n\nAlways make sure you configure a billing alarm for your account. Billing alarms prevent shocking surprise bills.",
