You will practice the skills you have learned throughout the course to optimize infrastructure for cost and performance. You will also use Terraform to provision and configure AWS services in a global configuration.\n\n### Before you get started\n\nConfirm that you have installed the required tooling for this project:\n\n- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)\n- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)\n\nYou will also need user accounts for AWS and Terraform. \n\n\n#### Permissions  \nThe tasks carried out for this project should be carried out by a user logged in with the IAM role of Administrator with access to Billing information. You can learn more about setting up a user with the Admin role here:  [Creating Your First Admin User and Group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/getting-started_create-admin-group.html)  \n\n\n### Task 1: Create AWS Architecture Schematics\n\n#### Part 1\n\nYou have been asked to plan and provision a cost-effective AWS infrastructure for a new social media application development project for 50,000 single-region users. The project requires the following AWS infrastructure and services. Please include your name and label all elements of the infrastructure on the diagram.\n\n* Infrastructure in the following regions: `us-east-1`\n* Users and Client machines\n* One VPC\n* Two Availability Zones\n* Four Subnets (2 Public, 2 Private)\n* A NAT Gateway\n* A CloudFront distribution with an S3 bucket\n* Web servers in the Public Subnets sized according to your usage estimates\n* Application Servers in the Private Subnets sized according to your usage estimates\n* DB Servers in the Private Subnets\n* Web Servers Load Balanced and Autoscaled\n* Application Servers Load Balanced and Autoscaled\n* A Master DB in AZ1 with a read replica in AZ2\n\nUse [LucidChart](https://www.lucidchart.com/) or a similar diagramming application to create your schematic. Export your schematic as a PDF and save as `Udacity_Diagram_1.pdf`.\n\n#### Part 2\n\nYou have been asked to plan a SERVERLESS architecture schematic for a new application development project. The project requires the following AWS infrastructure and services.\n\n* A user and client machine\n* AWS Route 53\n* A CloudFront Distribution\n* AWS Cognito\n* AWS Lambda\n* API Gateway\n* DynamoDB\n* S3 Storage\n\nExport your schematic as a PDF and save as `Udacity_Diagram_2.pdf`\n\n### Task 2:  Calculate Infrastructure Costs \n\n1. Use the [AWS Pricing Calculator](https://calculator.aws/#/) to estimate how much it will cost to run the services in your Part 1 diagram for one month.  \n    - Target a  monthly estimate between $8,000-$10,000.\n    - Be mindful of AWS regions when you are estimating costs.\n    - Export the estimate as a CSV  file named `Initial_Cost_Estimate.csv`.\n\n2. Return to the [AWS Pricing Calculator](https://calculator.aws/#/) and reconfigure your estimates for the following scenarios: \n    - Your budget has been reduced from $8,000-$10,000 to a maximum of $6,500. What services will you modify to meet this new budget?\n      Export the updated costs in a CSV file named `Reduced_Cost_Estimate.csv` and write up a brief narrative of the changes you made in the CSV file below the cost estimate.\n\n    - Your budget has been increased to $20,000. What resources will you add and why?  \n      Think about where to add redundancy and how to improve performance. Re-configure your estimate to a monthly invoice of $18K-20K.\n       Export the updated costs to a CSV file named `Increased_Cost Estimate.csv` and write up a brief narrative of the changes you made in the CSV file below the cost estimate.\n\n### Task 3: Configure Permissions. \n\nIn order to complete this task, please ensure your IAM users have been [granted access to the billing dashboard](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/control-access-billing.html) (Activating Access to the Billing and Cost Management Console).      \n\n1. Update the AWS password policy.\n\n   - Minimum password length = 8\n   - Require at least one uppercase letter\n   - Require at least one lowercase letter\n   - Require at least one number\n   - Require at least one non-alphanumeric character.\n\n   Submit a screenshot of the Password Policy from the IAM Account settings page. Name the screenshot `udacity_password_policy.png` or `udacity_password_policy.jpg`.\n\n",
