These instances are great for workloads like fast interactive applications, moderately sized databases, and lower lifecycles like Development and test.. AWS burstable instances are T2 and T3 instance types.\n\n- Elasticity is the ability to acquire resources as you need them, and elasticity is ALSO releasing resources when you no longer need them. A service isnâ€™t elastic unless it releases resources it no longer needs, another major cloud differentiator. \n\n- AWS Auto Scaling monitors your applications based on criteria you specify and automatically adjusts capacity to maintain availability and performance. Autoscaling is an example of scaling up when you add servers as you need them, and scaling down when you wind down and terminating servers you no longer need\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Configuring your site to autoscale, even with elasticity, will add to your bottom line at the end of the month. Is it worth it? Let's say you are a small vendor with a small handmade inventory of low priced products. It probably isnâ€™t worth the extra expense. The first few visitors will buy all your inventory, the latecomers will crash your site, and you will go off to sew your quilts or distill your perfume while the internet recovers and looks for the next big thing. \n\nHowever, if you would welcome the attention and demand, you have plenty of valuable resources to share, and you will recoup the value in the additional expense, it is absolutely worth it to configure your site to autoscale when traffic increases. An example would be a person with deep knowledge on an obscure topic that few people know about. All of a sudden, the obscure topic starts trending and leads people directly to your site where you have several PDFs on the topic for sale and available for download! You will make up in valuable exposure what you could probably never buy on your own- publicity! \n\nAnother example would be a silly photo posted on your personal blog being linked by a Twitter account with millions of followers. People are going to click, laugh, and move on while AWS spins up servers and your costs rise. If you want to provide the world with a few hundred dollars worth of humor, you should do it! You might end up with a write up in Buzzfeed or an invite to The Ellen Show!",

Be mindful of idle EBS volumes and make sure they are necessary before you maintain unused volumes for long periods of time. \n\n- EBS snapshots are point-in-time backups of EBS volumes saved to S3 and serve as a lower cost alternative to maintaining idle EBS volumes\n\n- AWS EBS provides SSD or HDD volumes. SSD are for low latency/high performance applications like databases and HDD are for high throughput applications like big data workloads and infrequently accessed files in cold storage.\n\n- Costs with EBS HDD are considerably lower than EBS SSD \r",

We had an empty volume, so we didnâ€™t have a need to take a snapshot today \n\n- We no longer need to stop the EC2 instance and detach the EBS volume to resize it. EBS volumes can be resized while running, even if the volume is the root volume of a running instance.\n\n- After you increase the size of an EBS volume, you must use file systemâ€“specific commands to extend the file system to the larger size\n\n -  The volume must be formatted for the operating system it is attached to and mounted prior to use. \n-   New volumes must also have a file system installed prior to use. \n\rRead more here: \n- [Making an Amazon EBS Volume Available for Use on Linux](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-using-volumes.html)\n- [Making an Amazon EBS Volume Available for Use on Windows](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/ebs-using-volumes.html)  \n\n\r\r\r",
