Setup a new public subnet in your VPC for this exercise.\n\n2. Create a new Network ACL for the VPC.\n\n3. Observe the inbound and outbound rules for the newly created NACL.\n\n4. Associate the new NACL with the new public subnet you have created.\n\n5. Create a new security group in the same VPC. Do not add any rules at this time. Note down the security group name.\n\n6. Determine your public IP address (Hint: Google *what's my IP*).\n\n7. Launch a linux EC2 instance into the public subnet you have created. Assign it a public IP address and the new security group that was created.\n\n8. Attempt to ping the EC2 instance on its public IP address.\n\n9. Attempt to ssh into the EC2 instance.\n\n10. Update the NACL. Add an **inbound** rule, number 100, allowing TCP traffic. All ports (0) all IPs (0.0.0.0/0).\n\n11. Add an **outbound** rule, number 100, allowing all traffic, all ports, all IPs.\n\n12. Although your ACL now allows SSH, attempt to SSH and ping the instance. Neither should work since the security group has not been updated.\n\n13. Update the security group to allow SSH connections from your public IP address.  Also allow ICMP traffic from your public IP address.\n\n14. Again attempt the SSH connection, the connection should succeed (you don’t need to login).  Attempt the ping, it will still fail since we haven’t allowed ICMP traffic on the NACL.\n\n15. Update the NACL. Add a rule to allow ICMP traffic from all IPs.\n\n16. Try the ping again. This time it should succeed.\n\n18. Update the NACL. Remove the outbound rule that allows all traffic. Now the outbound portion of the NACL should be a simple deny all.\n\n19. Attempt the ping and SSH again. Note that they no longer work since the return traffic has been blocked by the NACL.\n\n19. Re-add the NACL allowing all outbound traffic. Verify that connectivity is restored.\n\n20.  Add an explicit deny in the NACL. Deny your IP inbound TCP connectivity on port 22.  \n\n21. Attempt the SSH connection again.

This widens the attack surface and leaves the environment open to exploitation.\n\nTo solve this, a device such as the NAT gateway is the most common solution.\n\nThe shortfall with the NAT gateway solution from a security perspective is that it is difficult to monitor and restrict traffic at the application layer to specific domains and sites. \n\n### Securing Egress Traffic",

Proxies can also be used to restrict traffic to allowed sites. There are a few drawbacks:\n\n 1. Additional Configuration: applications and instances that require internet access will need to be configured to make use of an http proxy. \n\n 2. The proxy farm itself will need to be configured, managed and maintained.\n\n- **In-Line Gateway Appliance**: \nThese appliances generally come from commercial vendors and provide a range of capabilities for controlling and inspecting outbound traffic out of the box.  Cost is the biggest barrier to this approach.\n\n- **Host-Based IDS**:\nA host-based IDS is an agent based solution that runs on each instance. Providing many of the capabilities that the in-line gateway appliance provides including egress control and data loss prevention, intrusion detection and prevention. The biggest disadvantage is enforcing that  all hosts in your environment have the agent running.",

Developers need network connectivity to the Kubernetes cluster to manage on 6443. They do not need to login to any instances.\n\n2. Application containers need connectivity to the database on Postgres port.\n\n3. The data science team needs access to the database as well. They do not need access to the application cluster.\n\n4. The applications will need to connect to an external service such as Mailgun. At this time, we don’t know Mailgun’s IP ranges or what other services the application will need to connect to.\n\n5. We want to monitor network traffic from the application containers out to the internet.\n\n6. All access needs to be the least privilege. Security group rules should be as specific as possible.\n\n7. Team members do not have access to a corporate network.\n\nYou may either complete a new version of the diagram or a writeup outlining each layer of security that you would incorporate into this design.\n\nBe sure to be specific about chosen tools and products and how they would help make this environment more secure.\n\n### Hints and Approach\n- Fine tune each security group to only allow access from IP ranges or security groups which need access. Ensure ports are specific.\n- Stick with a bastion or VPN client based approach to allow team members access to the environment. A new security group should be set up for the VPN clients or bastion host users.\n- Research container based IDS/IPS/host monitoring solutions, aqua, sysdig, alertlogic, twistlock are notable products. Just include a few sentences on how the chosen tool might meet the requirement.",

The public key can be hosted on cloud servers and the private key is held by the user. Only a user with the private key that corresponds to the public key will be able to authenticate to the SSH server.\n\n#### Privilege Access Management (PAM) Tool\nA privileged access management tool provides management of authentication, sessions, password storage, audit, and privilege escalation when it comes to logging into server infrastructure.\n\n#### AWS Systems Manager (SSM)\nThe AWS Systems Manager service provides the ability to manage EC2 instances at the operating system level - including patching, command execution, automation, state management, inventory.\n\n#### Session Manager\nSession Manager is a feature within AWS Systems Manager which allows an authenticated IAM user or role the ability to start a terminal session on an EC2 instance.\n\n#### Open Vulnerability\nAn exploitable vulnerability in the OS kernel, packages, or applications installed on an instance which could lead to a remote actor gaining unauthorized access.\n\n#### Immutability\nA deployment model where components do not undergo any changes from provisioning to deprovisioning.\n\n#### Immutable Instances\nInstances that are launched from pre-configured images and do not undergo any changes from deployment to deprovisioning.\n\n#### Configuration Management Tool\nTools that can enforce operating system configuration state based on versioned code templates.\n\n#### Intrusion Detection System (IDS)\nA process that monitors system activity and identifies suspicious behaviour indicating that a server has been compromised.\n\n#### Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)\nTools that aggregate system events and logs in order to provide historical and real-time analysis, correlation, dashboards, and alerting.\n\n#### Ingress\nIn-bound network traffic that is entering your cloud environment from the outside.\n\n#### Egress\nOut-bound network traffic that is leaving your cloud environment.\n\n#### Internet Gateway\nNetwork component that is part of a VPC that facilitates out-bound and in-bound traffic to the internet.\n\n#### NAT Gateway\nA NAT Gateway is an AWS managed network component which allows instances in private subnets to connect to the internet but does not allow connection attempts from the internet to reach private instances.\n\n#### Proxy Layer (or Proxy Farm)\nA set of HTTP proxy servers designed to handle internet bound HTTP traffic.  This solution provides additional visibility and control on which internet sites can be reached.\n\n#### VPN\nExtends a private network such as an AWS VPC to an on-premise LAN or a user’s local host.  VPNs are encrypted tunnels that go over the internet.\n\n#### Direct Connect\nA dedicated and private network link between a company's on-premise local network and an AWS Direct Connect location - enabling two way traffic between AWS resources and the local network.\n\n#### Network ACL (NACL)\nFirewall construct in AWS which allows controls to be placed on VPC subnet network traffic.\n\n#### Security Group\nFirewall construct in AWS which allows controls to be placed on individual resources that are deployed in a VPC.\n\n#### Bastion Hosts\nBastion hosts, or jump hosts, are set up in a public subnet to allow a user to login from either their home or office network, and subsequently access or jump to resources in private networks.\n\n#### Virtual Desktop Solution\nA desktop deployed in a cloud VPC that can be used to run applications that need connectivity to resources in the VPC. A user would install a virtual desktop client on their local host to connect to the virtual desktop.\n\n#### Client VPN\nA secure tunnel between a user's local host and a VPN server in a cloud VPC. The tunnel is established using a VPN client running on the user's host.\n\n#### Site-to-Site VPN\nA secure network tunnel between a local trusted network and the AWS VPC, using the AWS VPN service or other VPN product.\n\n#### Direct Connect\nA dedicated and private network link between a company's on-premise local network and an AWS Direct Connect location - enabling two way traffic between AWS resources and the local network.",
