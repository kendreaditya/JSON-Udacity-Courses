This project will culminate in a model that can predict the presence of pneumonia with human radiologist-level accuracy that can be prepared for submission to the FDA for 510(k) clearance as software as a medical device. As part of the submission preparation, you will formally describe your model, the data that it was trained on, and a validation plan that meets FDA criteria.\n\nYou will be provided with the medical images with clinical labels for each image that were extracted from their accompanying radiology reports.\n\nThe project will include access to a GPU for fast training of deep learning architecture, as well as access to 112,000 chest x-rays with disease labels acquired from 30,000 patients.\n",

You can also find the notebooks containing the necessary starter code in the workspace. \n\nYou may also download all of the files for the project directly from [this repo](https://github.com/udacity/AIHCND_C2_Starter). \nThis workspace contains:\n- `EDA.ipynb`: This is the file you will be performing the EDA.\n- `Build and train model.ipynb`: This is the file you will be building and training your model.\n- `Inference.ipynb`: This is the file you will be performing clinical workflow integration.\n-  `.dcm` files: They are the test files to test the clinical workflow integration.\n- `sample_labels.csv`: This is the file that should be used to assess images in the pixel-level.\n- `FDA_Submission_Template.md`: This is the template for you to create the FDA submission. Please copy the template into your choice of editor. Finish the documentation, save it as a .pdf file, and upload. \n\n**Note:** The NIH data for EDA and training is mounted in the Udacity Jupyter GPU workspace provided to you along with the code to load the data. Alternatively, you can download the data from the [kaggle website](https://www.kaggle.com/nih-chest-xrays/data) and run it locally. You are STRONGLY recommended to complete the project using the Udacity workspace since the data is huge, and you will need GPU to accelerate the training process.\n\nDetailed instruction for this project is provided in this [**README**](https://github.com/udacity/AIHCND_C2_Starter/blob/master/README.md) file.",
