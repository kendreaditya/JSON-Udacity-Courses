As the need and capability arose to transition from paper to electronic medical records, EHR was born. There was even a law created to help this along. You might have heard of it. HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, was passed in 1996 to address this. You'll learn more about this in the EHR Data Security section of the course. \n\n- **HIPAA**: Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act\n\nEHR is also commonly referred to as \n- **EMR**: Electronic Medical Record\n\n\n\n",

Regardless of the exact amount, anything in this range shows the large volume of claims that are being processed. In addition and related to the access is the high cost of healthcare in the U.S. for 2019, Personal Healthcare Costs in the U.S. was projected to be $3.24T by [CMS](https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/NationalHealthExpendData/NationalHealthAccountsProjected). This is an enormous amount and to put that in perspective that 3T number is almost 15% of the U.S. GDP for 2019.

Data such as:\n- Heart rate monitors\n- Xrays and other radiology scans\n- Fitness trackers\n- Other diagnostic tests\n\nAll this helps to provide a 360-degree view of a patient's health. Ensuring that this data is collected in an electronic health record is very valuable to the patient and their caregivers. This data becomes even more critical when you can get a longitudinal view of a patient's data and collect it in a way that allows healthcare professionals and data scientists to make meaningful and accurate predictions.\n\nTo make this data even more impactful and create better insights and predictions, we need to be able to aggregate the data of many to help address some of the most significant opportunities in healthcare. \n\nMany companies are doing great things with healthcare data including Google and Apple.\n- [Apple Healthcare Data]((https://www.apple.com/healthcare/health-records/)\n- [Google Cloud Healthcare API](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/concepts/projects-datasets-data-stores)\n- [Google Health](https://health.google/)",

One of the major challenges in the U.S. healthcare system is reducing administrative errors and with AI and streamlined technology, we might eliminate many manual error-prone processes.\n\nEHR data will also contribute to better diagnostics, companies are leveraging the large datasets on populations to find ways to predict diseases and conditions well before they occur by seeing trends that only these large datasets can provide.\n\nLastly, EHR will unlock more powerful treatments by combining EHR data with other data sources like genetics and imaging data to build even more powerful and personalized treatments. Companies are already using EHR data to identify patient cohorts and clinical trials more effectively and predicting risks for different drugs based on population data instead of only human expertise.\n",

While these statistics might be subject to multiple interpretations, there is a collective agreement that access to quality healthcare is an issue for many globally and also in the U.S.\n\nThese are only **some** of the many opportunities of using AI with EHR data in healthcare. Hopefully, after completing this course, you will be able to apply your new skills to make a huge breakthrough in the medical world.

We are the gatekeepers of that data and if we want to be able to do amazing things with this data, we need to ensure it's safe.  Of course, these rules also protect medical professionals as well. \n\nYou will learn about the different regulations around the world which you should be aware of to ensure your data practices meet these regulations. You'll also learn who generally takes care of making sure your data is compliant before it even gets to you. \n\nWe will be reviewing and completing some exploratory data analysis following the CRISP-DM framework to address some common issues with data before we begin using it to build and test our models.

Not only will you understand why unintended demographic bias is so important to address, but also how to address unintended biases using a project called Aequitas.\n\nThen, you'll get a review of uncertainty estimation and Bayesian probability before Training an Uncertainty Estimation Model with TF Probability. \n\nFinally, we'll use Shapely values to help interpret your model.\n\nWow, looking at this course, it might seem like a lot, but by the time you have finished, you will have gains some amazing skills you can put to use in the ever-growing and important industry of healthcare!\n\n",

We will be working with some fantastic libraries like: \n - Python\n - Numpy\n - Pandas\n - Seaborn\n - Matplotlib \n - TensorFlow\n - TensorFlow Probability\n - Aequitas\n - Shapley \n\nTo be able to complete this course, you need to have:\n- Intermediate Python\n- Basic understanding of machine learning\n\n**This is not an introductory course and you should have a solid foundation in these skills before taking this course.** \n\nLuckily, Udacity has many fantastic courses in these areas to get you up to speed if you need them!\n\nWhile this course focuses on Python and Tensorflow there are many other tools you might be exposed to working with AI and EHR. \n\nFirst, for really big data sets and more computing power, you might use one of the cloud providers like\n- Google Cloud Platform\n- Amazon AWS\n- Azure\n\nSome other popular languages for working with AI in healthcare might include:\n- R\n- Julia \n- SQL (on cloud query engines such as GCP Big Query and AWS Athena)\n\nFinally, other popular Machine Learning packages include:\n- PyTorch\n- Scikit-learn\n- PySpark\n\nWhile some of the features shown in this course are specific to TensorFlow, many of the important techniques you will learn will apply no matter where or how you create your models. \n\nFinally, you may encounter some EHR data systems. Below are only a few of them.\n- Cerner\n- Epic\n\nHowever, it is unlikely you would be working directly with these systems, but it's good to know about them. \n\n#### Additional Resources\n- [Python](https://www.python.org/)\n- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)\n- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/)\n- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)\n- [MatPlotLIb](https://matplotlib.org/)\n- [TensorFlow 2.0/2.1](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/effective_tf2)\n- [TensorFlow Feature Columns](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/feature_column)\n- [TensorFlow Probability](https://www.tensorflow.org/probability)\n- [TensorFlow `DenseFeatures`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/DenseFeatures)\n- [Shapley](https://pypi.org/project/Shapely/)\n- [Aequitas](http://www.datasciencepublicpolicy.org/projects/aequitas/)\n- [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/)\n- [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)\n- [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/)\n- [R](https://www.r-project.org/)\n- [Julia](https://julialang.org/)\n- [SQL](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_intro.asp)\n- [Big Query](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery)\n- [AWS Athena](https://aws.amazon.com/athena/)\n- [Scikit Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)\n- [PySpark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/index.html)\n- [Cerner](https://www.cerner.com/)\n- [Epic](https://www.epic.com/)",
