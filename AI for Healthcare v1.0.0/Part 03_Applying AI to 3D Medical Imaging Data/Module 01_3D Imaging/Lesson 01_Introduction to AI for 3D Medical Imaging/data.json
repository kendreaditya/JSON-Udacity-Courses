Here is a diagram that may help you build a mental picture as we dive deeper into these concepts and how they play together.",

A proposal for the Dartmouth summer research project on artificial intelligence, 1955](http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/history/dartmouth/dartmouth.html)\n\nThe summer research project proposal, which introduced this definition, is thought to have laid the foundation of the field of artificial intelligence study. \n\nFor the purpose of this course, we think of AI as an: \n\n> Application of Machine Learning techniques to a real-world problem, improving human productivity and capability.\n\nWe would like to focus on the “real world” aspect of technology, and teach you the two sides of the implementation of AI for the purpose of 3D medical image analysis: \n- the thought processes of clinicians and radiologists and what kind of ML-powered technology would be most impactful to them\n- data, tools, and algorithms that need to come together to bring about a machine learning algorithm which could produce an analysis of a 3D medical volume\n\nOur vision is that firmly grasping of both sides makes someone a good AI engineer, that is someone who understands all of the following:\n- how data is produced and curated\n- what kinds of machine learning algorithms and statistical models can utilize this data to solve clinical problems, and in what way\n- how trained models need to be integrated into a clinical environment, and how some of the related fields apply; fields such as human-computer interaction, user experience design, regulatory frameworks, ethics, and data privacy\n\nIf you share these views and you want to get to know the field better, there is a good chance that you will find this course quite useful.",

The ACR is a US professional society that develops guidelines for the use of medical imaging technology. \n\nRecently the ACR has been actively working with clinicians and regulators to define the use cases for AI in radiology and help the FDA find the proper regulatory frameworks for various AI techniques. Two initiatives are worth taking a look now:\n\n* ACR has been developing a comprehensive list of use cases for AI in radiology: https://www.acrdsi.org/DSI-Services/Define-AI\n* the ACR has been keeping track of FDA cleared tools for radiological imaging: https://www.acrdsi.org/DSI-Services/FDA-Cleared-AI-Algorithms\n",

If you feel like you need to get a deeper understanding of the subject, we recommend looking for some of the Udacity courses, like the [Deep Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101) or some of the free resources like Stanford’s [video lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3FW7Lu3i5JvHM8ljYj-zLfQRF3EO8sYv) and [tutorial](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/tutorial/supervised/LinearRegression/). Another good resource is the [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/) course which has been built by Jeremy Howard who has co-founded a medical imaging AI startup, Enlitic.\n* **PyTorch or any other specific libraries**. If you want to get a fundamental grasp of PyTorch specifically, we recommend PyTorch’s [tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html) or the [free Udacity course](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-pytorch--ud188). We will also use NumPy quite a lot and if you need a quick intro into that, the [official tutorial](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/quickstart.html) gives you everything you need to understand the code in this course.\n* **High-performance/large-scale computing on massive medical imaging datasets**. Medical imaging datasets may become big (we are talking hundreds of gigabytes). Using them efficiently would tap into generic software architecture skills for building distributed systems, most likely using the major clouds. Every cloud provider offers a set of resources on the optimal use of their technologies. For example, you can take a look at [Microsoft’s design patterns for machine learning at scale](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/data-guide/big-data/machine-learning-at-scale)\n* **Diagnostic medical imaging**. While you will hopefully gain some intuition required for an understanding of radiological images and clinicians' thought process better, it takes years of medical school and residency to become proficient with using 3D medical imaging for clinical purposes. [Radiopaedia](https://radiopaedia.org/) is a great resource to look at the variety of sample radiological cases and get familiar with how various conditions present in radiological studies.",

              "text": "## Tools and libraries\n\nIn this course, you will use standard data science/machine learning tools:\n- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)\n- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)\n- [Python](https://www.python.org/) \n- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)\n\nWe will learn and use some of the libraries specific to medical imaging: \n- [PyDicom](https://pydicom.github.io/)\n- [NiBabel](https://nipy.org/nibabel/)\n\nAnd some of the interactive tools for working with images and debugging networks :\n- [3D Slicer](https://www.slicer.org/)\n- [Microdicom](http://www.microdicom.com/)\n- [Radiant](https://www.radiantviewer.com/)\n- [Dcmtk](https://dcmtk.org/)\n\n## Environments\nFor all the exercises and the final projects, all the tools and libraries will be available to you through Udacity Workspaces right here on this website, i.e., you do not have to worry about configuring anything locally or setting up some cloud-based infrastructure. \n\n### A. Udacity Environment\nEverything is set up, but here are some notes on how to use the different functionality enabled for this course. Most of the workspaces will be jupyter notebooks and are ready to go. Below is a list of the other types of workspaces you will encounter and how to use their functionality. \n\n#### JupyterGPU\nThis workspace is a jupyter notebook but has GPU as an option for you to use. At the bottom left of that workspace you will be able to enable/disable GPU. You will only be allocated a set amount for the course so while you are just coding you should disable the code. And when you want to run any machine learning then you can run the GPU to speed that process up. \n\n#### VNC\nThis workspace will include the ability to access a VNC or virtual desktop. These environments will use the GPU to access the VNC and the environment, medai. You can also disable this when you are coding (and not running the code) or writing an explanation in the starter files. You will also be able access a couple of different functions listed below when it is necessary for the exercise:\n\n- **Jupyter Notebooks** - In any terminal use the following command \n```bash launch_jupyter.sh```\nAnd from there you can find the URL contained in the box created by the asterisks(*) and paste this in the address bar of the web browser you are using to open a jupyter notebook with the relevant files in the `home` directory.\n- **Slicer** - You will need to enable the GPU as Slicer is already configured on the VNC. When you enter the VNC with the Desktop button at the bottom right hand corner, you can find a Slicer as a shortcut on the desktop.\n\n### B. Local Machine\nHowever, if you would like to run the exercises on your own local machines, below is a list of things you need to install on your local machine before running exercises.\n\nFirst, you would need a Python 3.7+ environment with the following libraries:\n\n* [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) (preferably with CUDA)\n* [nibabel](https://nipy.org/nibabel/)\n* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html)\n* [numpy](https://numpy.org/)\n* [pydicom](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/tutorials/installation.html)\n* [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html) (should be installed with pytorch)\n* [tensorboard](https://pypi.org/project/tensorboard/)\n\nIn the final lesson of the course, the exercises will have you work with some extra tools:\n* [3D Slicer](https://www.slicer.org/) for viewing and annotating 3D volumes\n* [DCMTK tools](https://dcmtk.org/) for testing and emulating a medical imaging device. Note that if you are running a Linux distribution, you might be able to install dcmtk directly from the package manager (e.g. `apt-get install dcmtk` in Ubuntu)\n\n",
