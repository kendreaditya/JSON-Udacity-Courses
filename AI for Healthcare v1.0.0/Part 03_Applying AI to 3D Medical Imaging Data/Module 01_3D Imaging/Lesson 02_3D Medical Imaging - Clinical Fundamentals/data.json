To help you narrow down some potential ideas, we will use the American College of Radiology Data Science Institute (ACR DSI) curated list of use cases. Alternatively, you may explore any clinical problem of your choosing without using the database if you already had something in mind. Please note that some use cases in the ACR DSI database can seem overwhelming or obscure without some background medical knowledge. If this is the case, simply choose something that’s more intuitive. A few good starting examples include: \n- Acute Appendicitis.\n- Aging Brain – Dementia.\n- Incidental Pulmonary Nodules on CT.\nYour task for this first part is to choose a case. If you choose to use the ACR DSI database, submit the link that points to your use case. If using any other resources, please submit an image capture or PDF of a medical or AI journal article that explores this problem within the context of machine learning.\n\n## Part 2: Background research.\nTo deliver an algorithm that performs well in a clinical setting, it can be extremely beneficial to have some rudimentary understanding of the disease or situation you are addressing. To do so, engaging in some background research to build your foundation will be crucial. For this part of the exercise, find a review article from the PubMed database describing the problem. Ask yourself, “what is the current gold standard for confirming or ruling out the presence of this disease/state”. Understanding the current gold standard/ground truth test will be a critical benchmark when testing any algorithm you develop. Submit a screen capture or PDF of the article to receive credit for this portion.\n\n## Part 3: Framing the problem as a machine learning task.\nWith some background knowledge of the disease or condition at hand, as well as how it is currently ruled in or out, consider how the task could be framed as a machine learning problem. We will be going over this in much more detail in the respective lesson of this course, but some early exposure will be useful. For example, solving the problem of autonomously detecting one or more lung nodules could be framed as an object detection task. Measuring changes in tumor volume over time may be best framed as a segmentation task. Etc. Submit a short paragraph detailing how you would frame your clinical problem of choice as a machine learning task, and explain your rationale.\n\n**Below you will find a workspace with a Jupyter Notebook where you can record the answers to each part of this exercise listed above.**",

In this exercise you’ve practiced some crucial skills you’ll use often -  how to choose a clinical problem, researching basic facts about the disease, and framing the clinical problem as a machine learning task.\nThere is no single right answer to the exercise, here is a sample solution below. \n\n### Lesson 1 Exercise – Sample Solution \n\n#### Part 1: Choosing a clinical case.\nI chose to focus on the case  - [COVID-19 Compatible Chest CT Pattern](https://www.acrdsi.org/DSI-Services/Define-AI/Use-Cases/COVID-19-Compatible-Chest-CT-Pattern). \t\n\n#### Part 2: Background research.\nI then focused on [Performance of radiologists in differentiating COVID-19 from viral pneumonia on chest CT](https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/10.1148/radiol.2020200823) paper by Bai, H.X., Hsieh, B., et. al. for my background research.\n\n#### Part 3: Framing the problem as a machine learning task. \nPer the ACR-DSI, the assigned task is to provide a likelihood of a diagnosis compatible with COVID-19 using chest CT data. I believe an initial step in solving this clinical problem, determining whether any abnormal findings are present on a chest CT, would be well-framed as an object detection task. The output would be a bounding box delineating the areas of abnormality that could indicate viral pneumonia. Based on recent literature, such findings could include consolidation, bilateral and peripheral disease, linear opacities, “crazy-paving” patterns, and the “reverse halo” sign. While these findings are not-specific for COVID-19, their detection could guide the ordering clinician to be more vigilant in follow-up testing for the disease. A negative STAT rapid influenza/RSV PCR tests and positive Real-Time Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (rRT-PCR) would confirm the diagnosis. ",

This presents certain health risks, but the short wavelength of this part of the electromagnetic spectrum allows the radiation to interact with the many structures that compose a human body, thus allowing us to measure the amount of photons that reach detectors and make deductions about the structures that were in the way of photons as they were traveling from the source to the detector, with a high precision.\n\n## CT scanners\n\nAs you have seen, the CT scanner operates by projecting X-rays through the subject’s body. \n\nX-rays get absorbed or scattered by the anatomy and thus detectors measure the amount of this attenuation that happens along each path that the ray is taking. A collimator shapes the beam and ensures that the X-rays only pass through a narrow slice of the object being imaged. Rotation of a source inside a gantry makes sure that projections happen from different angles so that we can get a good 2D representation of the slice. The moving table ensures that multiple such slices are imaged. A collection of slices makes up a 3-dimensional CT image.\n\nIn the exercise that follows we will look closer at how the formation of 2D slices works in a CT scanner.\n",

Of course, I meant “source”, when referring to the fact that in the real CT scanner the X-rays are cast in a fan shape from a very small area of the X-ray tube.\n\nI hope this exercise was useful and helped you get a grasp on how a CT scanner is functioning. Note that in the exercise you have seen how a backprojection algorithm is used to build a single 2D slice through a patient’s body. Transition to 3D is made by stacking multiple such slices which are acquired in a relatively rapid succession (a few slices per second).\n\nYou can find the solution to this exercise in the repo [here](https://github.com/udacity/nd320-c3-3d-med-imaging/blob/master/clinical-background/exercises/2-ct-backprojection/solution/Exercise.%20CT%20backprojection.ipynb).\n\n### New Vocab\n- **Sinogram**: “raw” data generated by CT scanner.

This effect is particularly pronounced in protons that make up hydrogen atoms. Hydrogen atoms make up water molecules, and water makes up to 50-70% of a human body. \n\nThe thing with protons is that they possess a property called spin which could be thought of as spinning around an axis. In a normal environment, the direction of this axis is randomly distributed across different protons. In the presence of a strong magnetic field, though, the proton spins get aligned along the direction of the magnetic field, and start precessing (think of what a spinning top that’s lost some of its momentum is doing):",

Look up “[MRI metal chair experiment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BBx8BwLhqg)” on YouTube to get a sense of what that is like. Such a static magnet can rip metal from a patient’s body - that is why anyone going into a scan will get asked if they have any magnetic implants and will be asked to remove any jewelry. That is also why certain patients (e.g. with metal shards left over from a trauma) would not be able to get imaged in an MRI scanner.\n\nWhen an external radiofrequency pulse is applied, of a frequency proportional to the frequency of precession, the protons respond to this pulse in unison, or *resonate*, and flip the orientation of their spins. Once this pulse is gone, they return to their original orientation (along the static magnetic field). \n\nThe way in which protons return to their original orientation is different and depends on the tissue type that protons are a part of.\n\nSince many protons are returning to their original orientation at once, they generate electrical currents in the coils that are placed nearby. Due to the resonance effect these currents are not insignificant and can be measured - these measurements constitute the data about the tissue being studied which is collected by the MRI scanner.\n\nGradient fields are used to vary the static magnetic field, and thus precession frequency, spatially. This allows the MR scanner to isolate a part of the body (i.e. a slice) that is being imaging. Further gradient fields are used to isolate information coming from specific locations within a slice.

              "text": "# Summary\n\n## K-space and Reconstruction\nThe currents measured by RF coils get turned into a digital format, and represented as vectors in “**K-space**”. The concept of K-space goes back to the wave theory in physics and basically defines a space of vectors that describe characteristics of electromagnetic waves. \n\nIn our case, these wave vectors carry information about the characteristics of the matter in the space that has been measured. Essentially, these vectors record the spatial frequency of signal intensity, and thus, through the process that involves an Inverse Fourier Transform and a lot of de-noising and other optimizations, get turned into a familiar 2D image that represents a slice through a human body with different anatomy having different pixel intensity. This process is referred to as **image reconstruction** in MR physics. Typically, image reconstruction is performed on a computer that is directly embedded into an MR scanner, and the problem of optimizing or scaling image reconstruction alone is a very interesting one.\n\n> If you are familiar with Fourier Transforms, but the concept of “spatial frequency” still seems way too mind-boggling - don’t worry, it could be. However, image analysis through FTs is a common technique in image processing. I have a link to some good materials on the subject later which will hopefully help you understand this concept a bit better if you are interested.\n\nSimilar to a CT scan, multiple slices imaged with a pre-set spatial interval through a human body are combined to obtain the 3D image. Note, however, that due to greater control over the electromagnetic fields, MR scanners can obtain data directly for a 3D volume in a single “sweep”, without having to go slice-by-slice.\n\n## Pulse Sequences\nWe can vary the combination of gradient fields, RF pulses, and aspects of the signal that is getting measured. Together, these are called a **pulse sequence**. \n\nTwo very common sequences are called “T1-weighted” and “T2-weighted” sequences (technically - these two are looking at different aspects of the same combination of electromagnetic fields). T1 produces greater contrast resolution for fat, and T2 produces greater detail in fluids. Quite often, a contrast medium is used along with a T1 sequence to make certain structures stand out. Thus, the gadolinium agent is often used in neuroradiology to improve the visibility of things like tumors and hemorrhages.\n\nMany more sequences exist, including many which are proprietary to scanner manufacturers, and there is a field of medical physics that deals exclusively with pulse sequence design.\n\n### New Vocabulary\n- **K-space data**: “raw” data generated by an MRI scanner. Images need to be reconstructed from it",

People have been coming up with ideas on how to circumvent this limitation. \n\nOne such idea was building special medical monitors that use more than 8 bits per single color channel or are optimized specifically for grayscale representations (e.g., look up Barco monitors that have 10- and 12-bit grayscale technology). If you think that HDR TVs are new, think again - the medical imaging industry has been building those for decades!\n\nAnother idea would be trying to use all colors of the display or somehow optimizing the representation to fit the grayscale range better. We will post a link to some interesting experiments in this area in the next lesson, once you’ve had the chance to learn how medical images are stored.\n\n### New Vocab\n- **Windowing**: mapping high dynamic range of medical images onto the screen-space gray color scale",

              "text": "# Summary\n\nWe have touched on some of the most typical tasks that you would likely need to deal with when working with 3D imaging data. \n\nYou will probably use **3D reconstruction** to visualize your volumes. Typically 3D reconstruction capabilities are incorporated into medical imaging viewers and range from basic to very elaborate. In later lessons, we will take a look at some of the tools that you can leverage for this. \n\n**Multi-planar reconstruction** is something that you will do naturally as you will want to extract slices from volumes. MPR is something that any 3D medical image viewer can do, but a data scientist would likely be dealing with cuts through different planes a lot too. We will see examples of MPR further in this course, and you will be writing your own code to do this.\n\n**Windowing** task would have you map 10 or more bits of grayscale to the 256 colors your screen could display (or maybe the RGB colorspace). Windowing is the very standard very basic operation of any medical image viewer (not only 3D one)\n\n**Registration** will pop up if you are looking at tasks that involve combining data from multiple imaging modalities or change of structures in the same patient over time. Registration on its own is not a strictly defined task. There are options - you need to decide e.g. if distances should be preserved in the moving image, or if parallel lines need to be preserved, but the image can be shrunken or expanded. Because of such tradeoffs, registration is always defined within a context of a clinical task. Registration sometimes is available in more advanced image viewers, and there are also tools and libraries that you can lean upon to do it programmatically\n\nAn interesting thing about registration is that it can be formulated as an optimization problem. This problem is quite well studied and has some good analytical solutions, but can also be addressed by deep learning methods. \n\n# Further Resources\n\n* A great overview of registration, methods, and various issues: [Alam, Fakhre & Ur Rahman, Sami & Din, Aziz & Qayum, Fawad.
