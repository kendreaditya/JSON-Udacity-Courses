              "text": "## Summary\nBefore we can understand all the parts of the ECG wave, we need to first learn more about how the heart works. The heart is made up of four chambers, two atria and two ventricles. The **atria** pump blood into the ventricles and then the **ventricles** pump blood throughout the body. Each heart cell is polarized, meaning there is a different electrical charge inside and outside of the cell. At rest, the inside of the cell is negatively charged compared to the outside. When the cell **depolarizes**, positive charges outside of the cell flow inside and makes the interior of the cell positively charged relative to the outside. This depolarization causes the cell to contract. The movement of charges across a heart cell’s membrane is the source of the electrical activity that gets measured by an ECG.\n\nThe conduction of electrical impulses through the heart follows a regular pattern orchestrated by the **cardiac conduction system**. Each heartbeat starts with an impulse in the sinus (SA) node. The **sinus node** is the natural pacemaker of the heart and is responsible for setting the heart’s natural rhythm. The impulse then propagates throughout the atria and causes the atria to contract. Then, the impulse enters the **atrioventricular (AV) node**, which delays the propagation of the signal to the ventricles. This gives the atria time to pump blood into the ventricles. After a brief pause, the signal passes through the AV node and into the ventricles, causing the ventricles to contract. This is the largest electrical disturbance in the cardiac cycle. After the ventricles contract, they **repolarize**, meaning the ions move back across the cell wall to their initial resting state.\n\nEach part of this sequence is responsible for creating a distinct marker-- or wave --in the ECG signal. The P-wave corresponds to the depolarization of the atria. The pause between the P-wave and the Q-wave is caused by the AV node delaying the electrical impulse to the ventricles. When the ventricles contract, we see the large QRS complex. And finally, after some time, the ventricles repolarize, causing the T-wave. The atria repolarize around the same time as the ventricles finish contracting so that activity is not visible in an ECG because it is obscured by the S-wave.\n\nThis cycle repeats every heartbeat and results in a very regular and uniform looking signal.",

Finding these QRS complexes in the ECG signal is important for a number of algorithmic goals. It directly gives you information about the heart rate and heart rhythm and provides important context when doing more complex processing.\n  \nThe way we find these QRS complexes is by using an algorithm called the Pan-Tompkins algorithm.\n\nFor most event detection tasks like this, we start with preprocessing steps that will boost the signal and suppress the noise. For Pan-Tompkins, we start with the bandpass filter that selects for frequencies in the QRS complex and suppresses frequencies outside of that band. This is followed by a one-sample difference, which is analogous to a derivative operation. This will preserve the steep slopes of the QRS complex and attenuate shallower ones elsewhere in the waveform. Next, we do an element-wise square which non-linearly amplifies the larger portions of our signal and makes everything positive. Finally, we do a moving sum over a fixed window length. This takes advantage of the fact the QRS complex has a fixed width of 150ms. If we tune the moving sum window to 150ms, we can fully take advantage of all the energy in the QRS complex, while attenuating other spikes that are shorter or longer than 150ms.  \n  \nThe detection steps are fairly simple. We simply find the peaks in our pre-processed waveform and then threshold them to select for the QRS complexes.  \n\nNext, we take a look at the code for this algorithm, and we plot the output.",

On noisy signals, with small QRS complexes, we saw just how well the pre-processing steps could improve our signal. Still, we saw that sometimes it would not be enough and more complex detection rules need to be implemented. \n  \nIn the following exercise, we implement more sophisticated detection rules for just this purpose. \n\nThe overall goal here isn’t necessarily to understand the Pan-Tompkins algorithm per se; it’s really to get to a place where we can solve this kind of problem in any domain where you have some knowledge of the underlying physiology and the signal characteristics and the noise characteristics and you can do for your task what Pan-Tompkins algorithm does for QRS complex detection. As you learn more about these tools and operations that can boost signal and suppress noise in your specific domain, you’ll be able to build a better intuition for designing your own algorithm on your own problem.\n\n## Notebook Review\nIf you wanted to interact with the notebook in the video, you can access it [here](https://github.com/udacity/nd320-c4-wearable-data-starter/tree/master/ecg-processing/walkthroughs/QRS-complex-detection/) in the repo `/ecg-processing/walkthroughs/QRS-complex-detection/` or in the workspace below.

              "text": "We’ve discussed atrial fibrillation previously in the context of the Apple Heart Study and the Framingham Study. Now we’ll learn what atrial fibrillation actually is. Atrial Fibrillation is a type of **arrhythmia**, which is an irregular heart rhythm. \n\nRecall, in a normal heart rhythm, the sinus node generates the impulse that causes the atria to contract. This impulse is propagated to the AV node and then throughout ventricles, causing the ventricles to contract. This process results in a very regular rhythm called **sinus rhythm**.  \n\nIn **Atrial Fibrillation**, instead of the SA node being the sole location that begins the depolarization of the atria, there are multiple locations around the atria that will spontaneously and haphazardly generate an impulse. Each of these impulses causes a partial contraction of the atria, but no single impulse depolarizes the entire atria, so there is no coherent contraction of the atria. Occasionally, one of these impulses will reach the AV node, which will then cause a ventricular contraction. But this occurs at random times, so ventricular contractions occur irregularly.\n  \nWhen can we examine features of the ECG signal to detect atrial fibrillation? First, there is no P-wave because there is no coherent depolarization of the atria to cause an electrical disturbance large enough to create the P-wave. Instead, we see a fibrillating wave in the T-Q segment. Second, the QRS complexes are very irregular.   \n  \nWe mentioned earlier that atrial fibrillation is associated with an increased risk of stroke. Because the atria are not contracting completely, stagnant pools of blood will form in the atria. These pools can form blood clots that are then circulated through the bloodstream. As these clots pass through progressively smaller and smaller arteries, they may eventually obstruct blood flow to the brain and cause a stroke.  \n  \nNow we have seen how atrial fibrillation occurs physiologically and why it’s a potentially dangerous condition. Next, we will build an algorithm that automatically detects atrial fibrillation and other arrhythmias from the ECG signal.",

Our input signal will be the time between two QRS complexes, known as the RR interval (for the R-wave). This is also called the **inter-beat-interval**.

Recall that the RR interval time series is irregularly sampled heartbeat because we get a new measurement at each heartbeat, not at some fixed interval in time. As you’ll soon see, many of the features we want can be computed on an irregular time series, but some, especially frequency domain features, cannot. In that case, we’ll first have to make this uniform using interpolation before we can compute our frequency domain features.\n\nSo we can separate our features into time domain features and frequency domain features. The first few are summary statistics like min, max, median, mean, standard deviation. Then we want to compute the number of outliers. And we’ll say an outlier is an RR interval that is greater than 1.2 times the average RR interval in that record.\n\nNext, we want to compute the root-mean-square of the difference between adjacent RR intervals. And lastly, we want the percent of  RR interval differences that are greater than 50 milliseconds.\n\nBefore we compute our frequency domain features, we will need to regularize the RR interval time series so that we can take the FFT of it. We want to interpolate the RR interval time series onto a regular 4 Hz time grid. Then the features we want will be the largest FFT magnitude component between 0.04 Hz and 0.15 Hz.

Lower level algorithms operate on the raw data and produce a set of more meaningful and versatile metrics. These metrics can then be inputs into various higher-level algorithms that are more informative about the underlying physiology of the wearer, their health, or their disease state. This allows us to independently iterate on different parts of this stack. Making the underlying algorithms more accurate will generally improve the higher-level algorithms, but this is not always the case. It’s important to remember that any change made in the lower level algorithms will have downstream effects.  \n\nWe also saw how having a solid understanding of the physiological processes that generate our signal can have a profound impact on how we design our algorithm. \n\n\n## Lesson Outline\n - Heart Physiology\n - QRS Complex Detection\n   - Pan-Tompkins Algorithm\n   - Extending Pan-Tompkins\n - Atrial Fibrillation Physiology\n - Arrhythmia Detection\n   - Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2017\n   - Data Exploration\n   - Feature Extraction\n   - Modelling",

Responsible for generating the impulse that causes the heart to beat.\n- **AV node:** Part of the cardiac conduction system that propagates the impulse from the atria to the ventricles after a delay.\n- **Refractory Period:** The period after depolarization where a cell cannot depolarize again.\n- **Sinus Rhythm:** The normal, regular heart rhythm, paced by the sinus node.\n- **Arrhythmia:** An irregular heart rhythm.\n- **Atrial fibrillation:** An irregular rhythm caused by multiple, haphazard depolarizations across the atria.\n- **inter-beat-interval:** The time between successive heartbeats. Also called the RR interval.\n",

We’ve covered a lot in a very short amount of time.\n  \nThe material in the introduction to signal processing lesson can fill textbooks. Now you have enough practical knowledge with that material that you can use those techniques to build algorithms from scratch. We then covered the physics underpinning the sensors we worked with and learned about the typical signal characteristics in each of these domains. This is valuable information that is typically only gained with domain experience. With this head start, we went through three case studies of building real-world algorithms on real datasets. From activity classification with the IMU sensor, to QRS complex detection and atrial fibrillation on the ECG, you’ve gained valuable hands-on experience with the algorithm design and implementation process. Now you have enough practical knowledge to apply these skills on your own. \n\n## Final Project\nIn the final project, you will take your knowledge of the PPG and IMU signals and design an algorithm from scratch using the signal processing techniques we have learned in this course. After completing the final project, you will have the confidence to study this field on your own. The journey doesn’t stop here. Download more datasets from [Physionet](https://physionet.org/), look for papers that cite these datasets, and try to reproduce their results. Try exploring new ideas and new problems and you will gain depth in this field in no time. The tools you have learned in this course should provide you with a solid base for further study.",
