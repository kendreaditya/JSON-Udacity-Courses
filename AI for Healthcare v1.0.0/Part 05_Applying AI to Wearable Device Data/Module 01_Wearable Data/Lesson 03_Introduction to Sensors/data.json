The name of the game for building any kind of sensor is to convert a physical phenomenon into an electrical one - be it a current or voltage - which can then be digitized and stored on a computer. The component that does this is called the transducer. \n\nThis is easy to see in this example of how a microphone works. A microphone is basically a drum attached to a coil of wire around a magnet. The drum moves in response to vibrations in the air or sound. As you may have learned in your physics class when the coil of wire moves back and forth over the magnet, the changing magnetic field induces a current in the wire. The A/C current creates an A/C voltage in the circuit that is then measured using an ADC.\n",

The magnetometer will tell you that moving to the left means going East. Each of these sensors has 3 channels of measurements, each in a perpendicular direction in 3D space and would be labeled x, y, and z. This would be like measuring the acceleration up and down, left and right, and forward and backward. Device manufacturers can orient their accelerometers however they want, so we can’t assume that the z-direction is the vertical direction.\n\nWe won’t be dealing with gyroscopes and magnetometers in this course, but we will look at accelerometers. The animation below is a model of an accelerometer. There is a mass attached to springs and the mass moves a plate between two capacitors inside a circuit. This changes the capacitance depending on the location of the plate. Because the displacement of the mass on a spring is proportional to the force it sees, the changing voltage in the circuit is proportional to force and acceleration. If you combine three of these circuits together perpendicularly, you can measure acceleration in 3 dimensions. ",

              "text": "This also means that accelerometers are affected by gravity. For example, if we rotate our accelerometer 90 degrees, we can see gravity pulls the mass down and the accelerometer will see a voltage associated with 1 **g-force** or the magnitude of the acceleration due to Earth’s gravity. The accelerometer only measures 0 if it’s in free-fall.\n\nThis also means that when the device is stationary, you can measure its orientation. If all the acceleration is in the downward z-direction, then it’s flat on a table. Or if it’s all in the x-direction, then it’s tilted on its side. We’ll take a more in-depth look at this another phenomena in the next lesson where we look at accelerometer traces in detail.\n\nNot all accelerometers are implemented using this capacitor attached to a mass on a spring model, but they follow similar principles. For example, some accelerometers use a force sensitive resistor or a [piezoelectric crystal](https://blog.endaq.com/piezoelectric-accelerometers-how-they-work-and-where-to-buy) to modulate a voltage in response to an acceleration.

You can even tell that they are probably jogging on a treadmill as the speed slowly ramps up and down. And from the sharp cut-off around 50 seconds, maybe we can tell that they jumped off the treadmill or for some reason their treadmill session was cut short. I didn’t collect this dataset, so we can’t know for sure, but it’s interesting that we can learn this level of detail from just an accelerometer alone.  \n\n### Quiz\nReview the set of graphs to answer the following quiz.

The LEDs in a PPG sensor shine a typically green light into your skin and your red blood cells absorb that green light. The reflected light is then measured by the **photodetector**. When your heart beats and blood perfuses through the wrist, there are more red blood cells that absorb the green light and the photodetector sees a smaller signal. As the heart fills back up with blood and blood leaves your wrist, the more green light is reflected back and the photodetector reading goes up. This oscillating waveform can be used to detect pulse rate. See the illustration below.\n",

As an algorithms engineer you may have the rare opportunity to influence the design of the hardware that will acquire the signal that will then be the input to your algorithms. Being able to provide actionable quantitative feedback for various hardware prototypes will provide endless returns down the line when you start building algorithms based on that hardware.\n\nWe can see an example of this kind of analysis in [this paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6651860/) where the researchers analyzed the effects of different mediums (water vs. air) and temperature on the PPG signal quality and pulse rate estimation from a smartphone sensor.\n\nFirst let’s look at the pulse rate algorithm accuracy.",

Holter monitors are worn during stress tests after a patient has been diagnosed or is suspected of having a heart condition or for short-term monitoring. They’re typically not worn for more than a few days. \n\nBeyond that, there are chest patches that only measure 1-lead of the 12 lead ECG. These chest patches can last from a few days to a couple of weeks. In 2011, Alivecor started making a handheld device that paired with an iPhone to take an ECG. Apple Watch and Verily’s Study Watch both have ECG sensors embedded into the hardware. On a wristwatch, the two electrodes are moved to the wrist and fingers on opposing hands. Because of this, the ECG cannot be monitored continuously and passively like the chest patch or Holter monitor or other sensors on a wearable. However, a wrist-watch can be worn for years, while a chest patch only lasts for a few weeks.\n\nIn lesson 4, we will go over the physiology of the heart and the characteristics of the ECG wave in greater detail.",

A 12-lead ECG contains 12 channels of ECG signals, looking at multiple axes across the chest. However, it is only recorded for a few seconds to a minute while a patient is in a clinic. Holter monitors can measure an ECG for hours to a few days, but they typically only measure 3-5 leads of an ECG. The Zio patch measures 1 ECG leads for a couple of weeks, and a wrist-watch can measure 1 ECG lead intermittently over the years.\n\nEach of these points on the trade-off curve has different clinical utility. Wearables continue to try to make a case for their clinical utility and make inroads into clinical practice. ",

Typically we’d only measure ECGs from people that are suspected of having heart conditions. Now Apple Watch can measure and look for atrial fibrillation from its large, mostly healthy population. More research needs to be done into AF itself to really know how useful detecting it in this population actually is. For example, what does it mean when someone under 40 years old has AF. Are they actually at an increased risk of stroke? The Framingham study -- which found the association between AF and stroke -- was conducted in the 40s, 50s, and 60s when AF was diagnosed after coming to the hospital and taking an ECG. If a subject’s AF was not persistent enough to show up at that time, then it would go undiagnosed. In fact, for a lot of the stroke victims, it was unknown that they even had AF until after they came to the hospital for the stroke itself.\n\nAlthough the population of Framingham study was at a 4-5X increase in the risk of stroke from AF, it is unclear if the population that the Apple Watch is discovering AF for is also at this increased risk. What does it mean to the public health system when you're alerting all these people of AF just because you can monitor it more closely than you ever could before? And how should patients and their doctors respond when they discover AF? The Apple Heart Study paper mentions these concerns explicitly:\n\n> ...further studies are needed to better understand the public health implications of identifying irregular pulse in persons younger than 40 years of age.    \n\nand  \n> ...uncertainty remains about the benefits of diagnosing and treating asymptomatic atrial fibrillation...  \n\nWe have to address these concerns before we can really understand the value of using the Apple Watch as a screening or diagnostic tool.",

You should try to understand the physics that make the sensor work, explore real data from the sensor, and research what common noise sources are and the artifacts they produce in the signal. Seeing how your own body reacts with a sensor is a great way to get experience and build intuition when possible. Finally, examining the existing literature on your sensor and the conditions that you are using it in is critical for learning a larger picture of the sensor’s characteristics. \n\nIn this lesson, we learned how the three sensors we’re using in this course -- the IMU, PPG, and ECG sensors -- work. You now know what physical quantities are measured by each sensor, know what each sensor looks like, and learned about common challenges and noise sources that arise when working with these signals.\n\n### Outline\n- Wrist Wearable Demo\n- IMU Sensor\n   - IMU Overview\n   - Accelerometer Deep Dive\n- PPG Sensor\n- ECG Sensor",
