The reporting process will also help the student understand the many business applications of security testing.\n\nYou will perform a penetration test against PJBank CISO's virtual operations.\n\nThis includes:\n- **Organizational Reconnaissance** - Identifying where the organization's website is hosted, the platform on which it is hosted, and any DNS records of interest.\n- **Network Scanning** - The target company will provide a virtual machine intended for production point of sale and customer interaction. This virtual machine is to be scanned heavily to gather as much intelligence as possible.\n- **Vulnerability and Exploit Research** - You will spend time investigating software version discoveries for known vulnerabilities and any published exploit code. \n- **System Exploitation** - You will exploit two specific vulnerabilities on the system, though more exist. These vulnerabilities may compound on each other and lead to other mistakes made by the developers. \n- **Produce a Meaningful Report** - You will craft a single report that speaks to multiple audiences, some technical, some non-technical. This report will include an executive summary, significant findings, and reproducible methodology.",

The infrastructure that supports this training program has four components: \n\n1. The Debian server in the DMZ (DMZIServer | 10.1.0.7)\n1. A web Application Server in the DMZ (Debianx64DMZOnCloudNew | 10.1.0.12)\n1. The Internal Network Device (employee workstation) in the MZ (Win-10 | 10.1.2.4)\n1. A public web server <a href=\"https://learnaboutsecurity.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\"Learn About Security\"</a> (Learnaboutsecurity.com)\n\nThe external component provides general training information and links to third party training platforms like Udacity.com. This component is internet accessible and can be reached at learnaboutsecurity.com.\n\nThe internal component consists of a web Server - with a SQL Database backed located in the DMZ (Debianx64DMZOnCloudNew). This server is used for employee training. There is also a Debian Server that is used as a test server (DMZIServer | 10.1.0.7). Finally, there is a Win-10 device that the employees use to access the training application. \n\nAll devices can be accessed from the Kali-internal machine (10.1.2.5).\n\nGreat News! PJ Bank CISO was so impressed with your team’s performance, they decided to extend your contract term. Your new assignment is to test the new training program platform for security weaknesses. \n\nThe reconnaissance operations will include checking for public sources of information about <a href=\"https://learnaboutsecurity.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\"Learn About Security\"</a>. You will need to: \n\n* Identify where the public website is hosted\n* Identify which email provider the company uses (if any)\n* Confirm any content management system (CMS) deployed on the web servers (DMZ and Public)\n* Identify Software and services being used on the targets\n\nAnnotation, documentation, reporting, and screenshots collection as you go is strongly encouraged. The process of reporting as you go will ensure you stay within the time bounds of the contract.",

You also recall reading a blog (attached below) about how there is a hidden folder that stores access credentials by default (a copy of the web article is attached below). You should be able to reveal sensitive data by: \n\n* Running a directory scan (dirb) against DMZIServer using the Udacity wordlist\n* Reveal root access to the DMZIserver",

              "text": "### Phase Three: Vulnerability Research\n\nIn this third phase,  Let's say you discover the PJ Bank security team made patch updates to the DMZIServer after the last pen-test because it was riddled with vulnerabilities. If you recall from the lesson this is the same server that hosted the payroll application. Since it is also being used as a test machine for the training application, it can be targeted during this project.\n\nYou also recall reading an OWASP article (attached below) that discussed how system admins store snapshots of servers while they're in a vulnerable state. If the security team saved a snapshot of the server, it would follow the organization file naming convention: snapshot.march.tar.gz. Snapshots are also usually kept in the opt folder. For this phase, use the root credentials your collected in phase 1 to complete the following: \n\n* Read the OWASP web article attached below.\n* Exfiltrate march snapshot from the DMZIServer. \n   * hint: You can find it in the /opt/snapshot directory.\n\nIn addition to this research software versions that you might discover on the test server (DMZIServer), payroll server (Debianx64DMZOnCloudNew) and employee workstation (Win10), Once you discover a vulnerability, research ways to exploit them.  Hint: One of those vulnerable software should be the Xampp service you started. \n\nAgain, you are urged to follow reporting best practices and document most steps throughout the investigation, research, and exploitation phases of this test. \n\n### Phase Four: Exploitation of the Identified Vulnerabilities\n\nA vulnerability on one of the machine is an outdated version of Xampp. The next page provides you with a video tutorial on how to exploit it. Exploit this vulnerability to gain access on the vulnerable machine.  \n\nThe SSH credentials for the payroll server (Debianx64DMZOnCloudNew) can be cracked as well. From the course, we know the username is admin123, we just need to try and crack the password. Use the Hydra tool against the Udacity wordlist (/usr/share/wordlist/Udacity.txt)  to crack the password and gain ssh access. If you are not sure what syntax to use to run the password crack, use the help (-h) command or research the world wide web. \n\nThere are two major items to accomplish in this phase:\n\n1. Gain unauthenticated access to the employee workstation (win-10) by exploiting a vulnerable application.\n1. Crack the SSH root credentials to the payroll server (Debianx64DMZOnCloudNew), then demonstrate data exfiltration\n\nOptionally, feel free to conduct other exploits that you have learned in this course. \n\n### Phase Five: Reporting\n\nYou should produce methodology, screenshots, and documentation through the assessment. However, the final phase of this assessment is to produce a report that can be interpreted by executives, understood by the points of contact, and reproduced by the technical personnel assigned. \n\n**Significant Vulnerabilities** should be designated as they are discovered, added to the Executive Summary and guidance provided for remediation.",
