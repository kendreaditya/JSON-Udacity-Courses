              "text": "### Lesson 1 - Vulnerability Management.\n\nVulnerabilities are the weaknesses in our systems which hackers use to attack the system. We'll start this lesson by learning how to scan for vulnerabilities using automated tools. Then we will learn how to manage any found vulnerabilities in a central dashboard, prioritize them based on risk levels, and track response efforts and management decisions. We'll also learn how to manually calculate risk scores and assign risk ratings to the vulnerabilities.  We'll conclude the lesson with a discussion of false positives and false negatives.\n\n### Lesson 2 - System Auditing\n\nIn this lesson, we will learn how to read a test scope document and start gathering information about our target system. We will learn how to research the vulnerabilities find their exploits and how to validate the vulnerabilities by executing an exploit. Then we’ll learn how to prepare a report on our findings. We will end this lesson with a discussion about why some exploits are intentionally written with bugs. \n\n### Lesson 3 - Application Auditing.\n\nWe will start learning about application auditing by looking at the OWASP Web Security Testing Guide and how it can be used in our testing.  Next, we will learn how to send requests to a  web application and analyze the response that comes back. We will use semi-automated tools to increase the efficiency and accuracy of our tests. We'll also use fully automated tools to perform specific tasks to create output we can use in further testing. Finally, we'll look at other systems and products that are vulnerable to hacking.\n\n### Lesson 4 - Social Engineering\n\nIn this lesson, we will take a look at the human side of Ethical Hacking.  We will begin with a discussion of five opportunities in human psychology that hackers use to manipulate our employees. Then we will learn how to perform an enterprise-level phishing simulation and create malware. We will also learn how to create an effective landing page for social engineering attempts. We will wrap up our lesson with a discussion about the ethics of social engineering.\n\n### Lesson 5 - Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)\n\nWe'll start gathering open-source intelligence by using Exploratory Link Analysis.  Next, we'll learn how to do data mining. After we have gathered information, we will start grouping information and building links using a tool called Maltego. Then we will learn how to analyze the links and relationships we have established to create new information and draw conclusions based on the information we have uncovered. We will end the lesson with a brief discussion about using OSINT to uncover a hacker's identity.\n\n### By the end of this course, you will be able to\n\n* Manage the vulnerability lifecycle including scanning, analyzing, prioritizing, and managing risk.\n* Conduct an internal system and application audit based on international standards and methodologies.\n* Write industry-standard reports.\n* Manage an organization’s security awareness programs by emulating adversary activities and provide metrics for anticipating risk.\n* Audit the organization’s public exposure based on open-source intelligence.\n\n<hr>",

Hackers like Kevin Mitnick and Robert Morris were arrested for crimes including hacking into computer systems to steal proprietary code.\n\nAs the internet expanded further in the 2000s, major e-commerce, search engine, and social media platforms were attacked.  Even the International Space Station was breached. \n\nEventually, organizations became concerned about protecting their systems from hacking. They started to hire Ethical Hackers to be the good guys fighting the bad actors.\n\nMany legendary good guy hackers initially started as malicious actors and were sent to prison. When they came out of prison, they started to use their hacking skills to protect systems instead of hacking them.  Their efforts made the cyber world a better place for everyone.",
