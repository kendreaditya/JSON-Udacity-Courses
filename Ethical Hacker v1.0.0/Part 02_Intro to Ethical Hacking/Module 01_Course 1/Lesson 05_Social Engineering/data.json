This can be especially helpful if you are working with a large organization.\n1. **Build a landing page**\nA landing page is a website where the phishing email recipients will land if they click the link in your email. It is very easy to clone existing websites.  Popular social media login pages are often cloned for phishing attacks.\n1. **Create an email**\nCreating a realistic email is the most important part of the process and requires extensive research and analysis of the users. The users will not open the email if its subject line does not interest them and they'll stop reading after the few lines if the email is poorly written. They will not click on the link unless there is a compelling reason to do so.\n1. **Organize into a Campaign**\nIt’s like creating a small project. You set the time when users will get the email and you use a dashboard to see how many employees opened the email, how many clicked on the link, and who submitted data.",

              "text": "## Creating A Persuasive Landing Page\n\n### 1.  Update the Document Title\n\nA document title is not an element visible on the page but is visible on the browser tab itself. It is a good idea to customize this otherwise the page will say index.html.\n\n```html\n <title>Grow Your Career</title>\n```\n\n### 2.  Add a Bold Headline\n\nYou need a bold headline that attracts the audience you are targeting. In this example, the words \"Instant Promotion\" will attract the attention of people who want a promotion.\n\n```html\n<h1 style=\"color: white;\">How To Get An <u>INSTANT PROMOTION?</u></h1>4\n```\n\n### 3.  Write a Subheading Focused on the Benefit\n\nYour subheading should focus on a benefit or result. In this example, the possibility of a reduced workload is the benefit that the target will get if they continue to read the page.\n\n```html\n<h2 style=\"color: white;\">While Working <u>EVEN LESSER</u> Than You Do Right Now!</h2>\n```\n\n### 4. Include an Interesting  Video\n\nAttention spans are limited but a video can both hold the target's attention and build trust. In this example, I used a YouTube video where I explain the infosec career ladder.\n\n```html\nsrc=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pV1KqAfYFa0\"\n```\n\n### 5. Add Attractive  Images\n\nNot everyone will watch the video, but interesting images will help keep them reading the page. In this example, the base template has three placeholders in the images folder which I replaced with the following images.\n\n1. Car - <a href=\"https://pixabay.com/illustrations/car-vehicle-sports-car-racing-car-49278/House\" target=\"_blank\">https://pixabay.com/illustrations/car-vehicle-sports-car-racing-car-49278/</a>\n1. House - <a href=\"https://pixabay.com/illustrations/house-cottage-brick-brick-house-4826263/Money\" target=\"_blank\">https://pixabay.com/illustrations/house-cottage-brick-brick-house-4826263</a>\n1. Money - <a href=\"https://pixabay.com/illustrations/dollars-coins-money-currency-517113/TextIt\" target=\"_blank\">https://pixabay.com/illustrations/dollars-coins-money-currency-517113/</a>\n\n### 6. Write Persuasive Text\n\nKeep the text short and focused on the benefits. Use bullet points whenever possible. In this example, I included reasons:\n\n1. Discover a perfect strategy for your next promotion\n1. Understand what your next HR is looking for\n1. Talk through seven successful lifestyle changes\n1. Uncover the secrets of 10X growth formulae\n1. Get ready for the millionaire mindset\n1. It is absolutely free!!!\n\n### 7.  Include Testimonials for Social Proof\n\nSocial Proof helps the target to overcome any fear they have by showing what other people are saying. Good social proof can put a lot of pressure on the target to say \"yes\" to what the website is offering.  In my example, I used three fake testimonials:\n\n1. Talking to Sagar was totally awesome! I have much better clarity in my life, a big thanks!\n1. It's been a few months since I met Sagar, and I take pleasure in recommending this insane offer!\n1. An incredible ecosystem where I got what I wanted and we helped each other as well. Highly Recommended!\n\n### 8. End With a Call To Action\n\nBy the time the target gets to the bottom of the page, they should be fully convinced to take action. In this example, I used the `tel:` attribute in the anchor tag to open the dialer app on the target's phone when the button is clicked.  The phone number is preloaded, which increases the possibility of a successful attack.\n\n```html\n<a href=\"tel:+19876543210\"><button> GET YOUR FREE CONSULTATION NOW </button></a>\n```",

              "text": "## Social Engineering Involves Real People With Real Emotions\n\nBy design, many social engineering programs, like fake websites and phishing campaigns, are intentionally deceitful. This can be uncomfortable for the organization and the person who is running the social engineering program.\n\nHowever, if it is designed carefully, a social engineering program will stay within ethical boundaries to minimize any harm to the organization and its employees.\n\n### Rules of Ethical Social Engineering\n\n1. **Don't use messaging related to the target's personal life**. \nCreating an effective personal message is unnecessarily invasive and requires extra work. General messages or department-specific messages are easier to implement and can be just as effective.\n\n1. **Don't make promises to the target or raises false hopes.** \nMessages that make false promises can be extremely dangerous because the target may act on this information in ways that are completely unrelated to your task and can permanently harm the target. Instead of GREED, focus on the HELPFULNESS. It can often be just as motivating and doesn't require you to give the target any false hope.\n\n1. **Don't embarrass the target.** \nToo much pressure on the target can cause a lot of stress and anxiety and may lead to serious emotional and health issues. We know that fear can be very motivating, and it often takes just a little bit of fear to influence the target to do what you want them to do.\n\n### Effective and Ethical Social Engineering Messages\n\n* \"Your account has been locked\"\n* \"We need your personal email\"\n* \"The client needs credentials right now\"\n* \"Confirm your information in this PDF\"\n* \"There is troubling information in your performance report\"",
