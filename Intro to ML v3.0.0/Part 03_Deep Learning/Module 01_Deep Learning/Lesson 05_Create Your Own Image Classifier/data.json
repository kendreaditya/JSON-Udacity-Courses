Management is trying to decide whether to *build* or *buy* an object detection algorithm for objects that may be on the side of the road. They are considering buying a computer vision algorithm from a company called Detectocorp. Detectocorp’s algorithm claims a 70% accuracy rate on the *CIFAR-10* dataset, a benchmark used to evaluate the state of the art for computer vision systems.\n\nBut before making this purchase, management wants to explore whether you can build an in-house solution that performs well. They have asked you to try your hand at creating a neural network that can classify arbitrary objects and potentially be fine-tuned on a larger dataset using transfer learning.\n\nUsing the skills you’ve acquired building neural networks using PyTorch, your task is to build an image classifier using the CIFAR-10 dataset and evaluate its accuracy. Then you'll compare its performance to both Detectocorp’s algorithm (which achieved 70% accuracy) as well as the state of the art results detailed in the notebook—and make a recommendation to management about whether to *build* the solution in-house or *buy* the algorithm from Detectocorp.",
